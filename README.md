# 📖✨ Digital Diary 📖✨  
*A C# Console Application for CS 222 - Advanced Object-Oriented Programming*

---

## 📌 Project Description  

Welcome to **Digital Diary** — your personal console-based diary application where you can write, view, and search through your daily entries 📅💬. All your thoughts are securely stored in a text file (`diary.txt`) and managed through C#'s file handling tools like `StreamWriter`, `StreamReader`, and `File.Exists`.  

This app follows **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles to maintain a modular, clean, and extendable code structure.

## 🌟 Features  

✅ Write a new diary entry 📓  
✅ View all your diary entries 📜  
✅ Search for a specific entry by date 🔍  
✅ Clear all entries securely 📛  
✅ Simple, intuitive console menu interface 🖥️  
✅ Text file-based storage using file handling classes 📁

## 🛠️ How OOP Principles Are Used  

- **Encapsulation 🛡️**  
  - The file path and diary entry handling logic are hidden within the `Diary` class. External code only interacts through safe public methods.

- **Abstraction 🎭**  
  - The `Diary` class offers clear, simple-to-use public methods like `WriteEntry()`, `ViewAllEntries()`, and `SearchByDate()` — no need for the `Program` class to know how these work internally.
